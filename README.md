# Hong Kong Tour Guide GPT

## Overview

This is a demo of a **Hong Kong Tour Guide Application** leveraging the Gaianet platform. This app will enable users to interact with a GPT-powered chatbot that provides information and recommendations about Hong Kong. The chatbot's knowledge base will primarily be sourced from [Hong Kong's Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong) and a [Timeout article](https://www.timeout.com/hong-kong/things-to-do/best-things-to-do-in-hong-kong) and structured as a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model.
